## What is Ethical Hacking?

**Ethical Hacking** is the practice of using hacking techniques to test and improve computer system security. Unlike malicious hackers (black hats), ethical hackers perform their activities with **official authorization** and aim to **protect**, not destroy.

### Why is Ethical Hacking Important?

- **Proactive Security** → Find vulnerabilities before malicious hackers do
- **Cost Savings** → Prevent expensive data breaches
- **Regulatory Compliance** → Meet industry security standards
- **System Validation** → Ensure security controls are working

**Note**: According to IBM, the average cost of a data breach in 2023 reached $4.45 million USD. Ethical hacking can prevent losses of this magnitude.

## Five Phases of Ethical Hacking

Ethical hacking follows a structured methodology:

### 1. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)

**Definition**: Gathering public information about the target without directly interacting with the system.

#### Types of Reconnaissance:

**Passive Reconnaissance:**

- Google Dorking to find sensitive information
- WHOIS lookup for domain data
- Social media intelligence (SOCMINT)
- DNS enumeration

**Active Reconnaissance:**

- Limited network scanning
- Website crawling
- Light port scanning

#### Reconnaissance Tools:

| Tool             | Function                              | Example Usage                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Google Dorks** | Find sensitive info in search engines | `site:target.com filetype:pdf`                |
| **WHOIS**        | Domain registration information       | `whois target.com`                            |
| **TheHarvester** | Email and subdomain gathering         | `theHarvester -d target.com -l 500 -b google` |
| **Maltego**      | OSINT visualization                   | Mapping relationships between entities        |

### 2. Scanning & Enumeration

**Definition**: Active scanning to discover live systems, open ports, and running services.

#### Scanning Phases:

1. **Host Discovery** → Find active hosts
2. **Port Scanning** → Identify open ports
3. **Service Detection** → Determine services & versions
4. **OS Fingerprinting** → Detect operating systems

#### Scanning & Enumeration Tools:

| Tool        | Function                             | Level        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| **Nmap**    | Network mapping & port scanning      | Beginner     |
| **Masscan** | High-speed port scanner              | Intermediate |
| **Nessus**  | Vulnerability scanner                | Professional |
| **OpenVAS** | Open-source vulnerability assessment | Intermediate |

### 3. Gaining Access

**Definition**: Exploiting discovered vulnerabilities to gain access to the target system.

#### Gaining Access Methods:

- **Exploitation** → Leveraging known CVEs
- **Brute Force** → Automated credential guessing
- **Social Engineering** → Manipulating human factors
- **Web Application Attacks** → SQL Injection, XSS, etc.

#### Gaining Access Tools:

```bash
# Popular tools examples
Metasploit Framework  # Exploitation framework
Hydra                 # Brute force tool
SQLMap               # SQL injection automation
Burp Suite           # Web application testing
```

### 4. Maintaining Access

**Definition**: Ensuring access to the system can be maintained for future use.

#### Maintaining Access Techniques:

- **Backdoor Installation** → Backdoors for re-entry
- **Rootkit Deployment** → Hidden tools at kernel level
- **User Account Creation** → Creating hidden accounts
- **Service Modification** → Modifying services for persistence

#### Ethical Considerations:

```
IMPORTANT: In ethical hacking, this phase is only for
documentation and demonstration. Backdoors must be
removed after testing is complete!
```

### 5. Clearing Tracks

**Definition**: Removing or hiding evidence of hacking activities.

#### Clearing Tracks Activities:

- **Log Deletion** → Remove entries from log files
- **Timestamp Modification** → Change file access times
- **File Deletion** → Remove tools and scripts used
- **Registry Cleaning** → Clean Windows registry

#### Clearing Tracks Tools:

```bash
# Linux
rm -rf /var/log/auth.log     # Delete authentication logs
history -c                   # Clear command history

# Windows
wevtutil cl Security        # Clear Security event log
cipher /w:C:\               # Secure file deletion
```

---

## Why Authorization and Ethics Matter

### Legal & Ethical Aspects

#### **1. Legal Compliance**

Ethical hacking MUST be performed with **written authorization** from the system owner. Without authorization:

- Violates cybercrime laws
- Can result in imprisonment up to 6 years
- Fines up to $1 million

#### **2. Scope Limitations**

Authorization ensures testing only on:

- Approved systems
- Specified timeframes
- Agreed methodologies

#### **3. Professional Trust**

With authorization, clients can:

- Prepare system backups
- Monitor testing processes
- Ensure no damage occurs

### Most Risky Phase

**Gaining Access** is the riskiest phase because:

1. **Direct System Interaction** → Direct interaction with target
2. **Exploitation Attempts** → Attempting to exploit security vulnerabilities
3. **Potential System Damage** → Risk of damaging systems if not careful
4. **Legal Implications** → Without authorization, it's immediately illegal

```
WARNING: Performing gaining access without authorization
is CYBERCRIME and can result in imprisonment!
```
